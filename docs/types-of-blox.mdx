# Types of Blox

We have predefined types for Blox in the registry. Each type refers to where and how it is utilised. Following is the list of Blox Types available.

## UI Blox

`UI Blox is a frontend Blox` as its name suggests, and is developed for browser runtimes. 

As of now, we only support React-based UI Blox. 

Each Blox can be a part of a business use case. For example, a login page with APIs integrated can be a Blox, which when connected with a matching Fn Blox will be enough to implement login functionality in any application.

`All UI Blox which has at least one Fn Blox integration should adhere to an API schema.`

UI Blox are of two types,

###  UI Element Blox. 

These are independently developed and tested `unit frontend Blox`.

This Blox is not supposed to work alone but be pulled into a UI container Blox/ host Blox and run together. This process of connecting the elements happens at runtime. 

Appblox enforces strict standard regulations as there are increased chances of runtime errors. It ensures that all the elements Blox which are supposed to be connected are composable by design.

### Container blox

These are the `orchestrators in the Frontend`. 

This type of Blox will have the main routing files and placeholders for the remote modules. It will decide when to pull and how to render a remote element Blox.

The Container Blox decides the layout of the entire app and it renders when you visit the app URL. 

It will pull the required bundles from the remote servers, stitch them together at runtime and render the app.

## Fn Blox

`Fn Blox are the backend Blox`. 

We design Fn Blox in a `FaaS Architecture`. 

Each Fn Blox is supposed to be `mutually exclusive`. 

Every Fn Blox will have a specific URL to invoke it and in practical scenarios, all the Fn Blox in an app will be stitched together and run in a single instance on the server.

In case a particular Fn is having more traffic, ie, needs to be scaled that Fn Blox alone will be isolated and run in a separate instance. 

Appblox gateway in the proxy layer will intelligently route the traffic between the stitched app and the isolated Fn Blox instance.

Fn Blox are language agnostic. Despite that, is always better for developers to stick with the same language in app development for maintainability.

All functions which have a database call should adhere to a database schema.

As of now, we only support Nodejs.
## Shared Blox

In both frontend and backend, there is `some piece of code that is not adhering to Blox Spec`. These are just `reusable pieces of code` such as a function to find the age of a person from dob.

With our efficient searching dashboard, it would be easy for a developer to find shared Blox for any random use case.

In the frontend, it can be either a very common function, for example, a function to find the difference between two dates or a reusable button with a default loader added. 

## App Blox

`UI, Fn and shared Blox have their own repositories`. They are the building blocks of an application. 

Once all the Blox are stitched together, we build a configuration that is a snapshot of how the apps are composed. 

This configuration can be pulled and run on any machine using Blox CLI. We call this hypothetical entity an `App Blox`. 

It's a collection of Blox that will act together as an application.

## Blox.config.json 

This is a `configuration file found in the root folder of all the Blox`. 

It will hold the `meta information of the Blox`, which can be read by the CLI / registry to identify the `Type of Blox, its repository, version etcâ€¦`

## Appblox.config.json

This `configuration file is at the root of any App Blox`. 

Appblox.config.json will have `meta-information about all the Blox in that App Blox` and other `necessary metadata about its runtime`. 

This configuration resides in the Blox registry and can be pulled by anyone who has the right access privileges.

Appblox CLI has APIs which can read this config, pull the dependencies and run them on the local machine. 

`We use this configuration file to get the necessary information while deploying.` So without this configuration, app deployment won't work.
