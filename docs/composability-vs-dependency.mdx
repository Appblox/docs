# Composability vs Dependency

## Composability

If `one or more Blox can be stitched together` into an application, then we say these Blox can be `composable`.

For example, if a login Blox and signup Blox derive from a common Spec, we can stitch these together to build an authentication module. Here, we can say that the login and signup Blox are  composable.

## Dependency

If a Blox is an `essential requirement for another Blox` to run, then the `former Blox is a dependency of the latter.`

A UI Blox with a Fn Blox integration has the Fn Blox as its dependency. Similarly, `if the Fn Blox depends on a Shared Blox (Utility Blox) for some use case handling, then the shared Blox is a dependency`.
