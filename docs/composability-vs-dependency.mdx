# Composability vs Dependency

## Composability

If `one or more **block** can be stitched together` into an application, then we say these blocks can be `composable`.

For example, if a login **block** and signup **block** derive from a common Spec, we can stitch these together to build an authentication module. Here, we can say that the login and signup **blocks** are composable.

## Dependency

If a **block** is an `essential requirement for another block` to run, then the `former block is a dependency of the latter.`

A UI **block** with a Fn **block** integration has the Fn block as its dependency. Similarly, `if the Fn block depends on a Shared block (Utility block) for some use case handling, then the shared block is a dependency`.
